The current `README.md` is the default template provided by Next.js when a project is initialized using `create-next-app`. While it contains valuable information about running and deploying the app, we can enhance it to reflect the actual progress and specifics of your **Job Application Tracker** project.

Here’s a revised and more relevant version of your `README.md`, incorporating the important details about your project:
